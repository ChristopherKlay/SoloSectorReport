# SoloSectorReport

## Live Version
[SoloSectorReport](https://christopherklay.github.io/SoloSectorReport/)

## Info
Similar to [Dungeon Report](https://dungeon.report/) and [Raid Report](https://raid.report/), Solo Sector Report aims at providing a quick, but detailed overview of a given users solo lost sector runs in Destiny 2.

## Development
This is purely a passion project developed by someone who spends too much time on Destiny 2.
Don't expect huge jumps and/or tons of new features, but the project will be improved over time.
